# Optimizing the picking and put away problem as tsp problem.
## Code files Structure
    1) netmeds_picking_optimization.py  (python file)
    2) overall.csv (csv file)
    3) Requirements text (txt file)
### Input format 
    In the source code, the nodes variable has to be updated with the pick list or passing the pick list as arguments to the program.
    Pick list in the format of list of elements 
        elements format : {aisle number}_{rack number}
    e.g. = 
       If pick list contains elements from aisle 1 rack 11 , aisle 2 rack 12 , aisle 10 rack 20 , aisle 20 rack 3 then input format should match with the given below(order of elements is not considered)
       [ "1_11" , "2_12" , "10_20" , "20_3"]
    
### How to run program?
    If pick list contains elements from aisle 1 rack 11, aisle 2 rack 12 , aisle 10 rack 20 , aisle 20 rack 3 then input format should match with the given below(order of elements is not considered)
       [ "1_11‚Äù, "2_12" , "10_20" , "20_3"]
    
    In source code update nodes variable and run the program
    or 
    Run the program by passing the input as arguments in command prompt
    python  netmeds_picking_optimization.py 1_11 2_12 10_20 20_3

### Output format 
    Two lines of output:
    1) 1st line contains the order in which elements must be picked for optimal path.
    2) 2nd line contains the fitness value of the path, lesser the fitness more optimal is the path.
